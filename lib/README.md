# Assignment 1 - API testing and Source Control.

GitHub repository: https://github.com/gullveigy/AccountingwithTestings.git.

## Overview.

This is an online accounting web app, and there are three models for the time being（users,expenditures and incomes models）.Each model corresponds to a file in routes.
Users model has the following properties: username(unique)/password/profile(has 3 nested properties:gender/email/phone);
Expenditures model has the following properties:username(unique)/date/payment/amount/description;
Incomes model has the following properties:username(unique)/date/incomingmode/amount/description;
Each file in routes includes some basic CRUD operations and fuzzy search, etc.

## API endpoints.

## Data storage.

My tests included the integration of MongoDB.(db name:"gullin",it has 3 collections:expendituredb/incomedb/userdb)

1. expendituredb:

        1) database schema
        
            let ExpenditureSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
                username:String,
                date: String,
                payment:String,
                amount: Number,
                description:  {type: String, default:null}
            },
            { collection: 'expendituredb' });

        2) json document structure example

            {
              "_id": {
               "$oid": "5bdd7ec0ef72153750b2df72"
            },
              "description": "Latte",

              "__v": 0
            }

2. incomedb:

        1) database schema

            let IncomeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
                username:String,
                date: String,
                incomingmode:String,
                amount: Number,
                description:  {type: String, default:null}
            },
            { collection: 'incomedb' });

        2) json document structure example

## Extra features.
1. GitHub repository: https://github.com/gullveigy/AccountingwithTestings.git.
2. Before writing test code, I connected the node server to a background database dedicated to testing,so my test code runs on the basis of the test database, and it would not cause any changes to the original database.
3. I implemented test-isolation,so each test file could be repeatedly run as a whole.
4. I have committed the put operation test in income-test.js as a work unit ,because at that time I implemented the test in two steps and commit 2 messages on that branch.
5. I have rolled back the code several times to a previous version(git reset --hard ........).
6. I used some get functions in put operation test and delete operation test in my expenditure-test.js and users-test.js.Before writing these test codes,I had tested get functions I used.I deleted get functions test codes before committing put and delete test,just to make the code blocks look neat.
